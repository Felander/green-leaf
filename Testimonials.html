		 <h2>Testimonials</h2>
		 
		 <ul>
		 <li><b></b> I just wanted to pass along the below note from an end user at Oracle along with a HUGE thank you from the Oracle Support team. 
		 James does quite a few recordings for Oracle users a day and he consistently goes above and beyond. He is always extremely friendly, thorough, 
		 and seems genuinely eager to assist.  If I IM him with a question (which happens quite a bit!) where I need some additional clarity, he asks 
		 if he can call me to help me understand.  I can say I deal with many individuals on a daily basis within InterCall, and this is not common process, 
		 though an extremely effective one.  His overall attitude comes across as not just to assist but actually to exceed expectations and create the best 
		 experience for both his internal and external clients. We often don't hear enough "good" in the day but I felt it would only be right to take a few minutes to make sure James gets the recognition he deserves. <br />
		 Thank you for providing such a phenomenal resource for me and my team! <br />

		Thanks, 
		 <b>Andrea W. - Oracle</b>

		 <li><b></b> James, Oh my - James.  I just don't know what to say.  Thank you so very, very much.  You truly are a miracle worker for sure!  After we completed this training Noelle and I both stated how totally deafening all of the silence was and seemed like it went on forever and then some!  This is just remarkable and I so appreciate your special magic. I also want to thank you for taking the time and helping us walk through the process, giving us some direction on the do's and don't. I think as you can hear on the recording, you are an excellent teacher.

		Again, I really appreciate your patience, direction, professionalism and expertise.  The team is extremely lucky to have you James and so blessed to have you recording. <br/>

		Thanks again,
		<b>Sharon S. - Oracle</b></li>
		<li>James - I just got a call from Tim Lambe at Fidelity. He wanted to let me know he and his staff were delighted at the job you did on the recording session today. 
		In his words, you made them feel extremely comfortable, were able to address all of their fears/concerns, and made everything extremely easy. In large part and due to 
		your efforts, Fidelity plans to do more of these recording sessions next year. Your professionalism is truly appreciated!<br /><b>Scott K. - InterCall</b>
		 <li>James, we are all done! Sheri and I can't THANK YOU enough for everything!!!! YOU absolutely saved the day and changed our horrible experience last Monday to a wonderful 
		 experience this Monday! You are professional, responsive, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with." </li>
		 <b>Mary Beth M.- MedImmune</b>
		 <li>James, thank you VERY much for recording our call today. This was a very important call for my team and your assistance took a lot pressure off of my shoulders.
		I appreciate your professional and prompt work and forwarding the recording to me so quickly.  I will know for whom to ask the next time:) </li>
		<b>Hanna K. - Commercial Banking</b>
		 <li>Hi James ..Thank you for taking care of Tyler in his setup for his event. I know that is over and beyond what you were tasked to do for my event, and I really appreciate how professional 
		 and patient you were with Tyler, as he is one of our executives that looks for that kind of service... and you provided it without anyone asking you to do that.  Impressive!!! Many, many thanks for your support.</li>
