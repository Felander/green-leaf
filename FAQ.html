		 <h2>FAQ</h2>
		 
		 <ul>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - Why did you name your company Greenleaf (Enterprises LLC)?</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - My wife and I thought about this and after a while of deliberating over this dilemma, she said that we should have the word "Green" in the title somewhere to illustrate that we are a green company. We do everything we possibly can do electronically: communicating with our clients, the services we deliver, ordering and billing are all done electronically. Occasionally we will have a client that cannot download something electronically due to a very restrictive firewall. In those cases we will send the client a CD instead. The "Leaf" part of the name came from where I live I guess. I live in a beautiful city with LOTS of greenery. It just kind of came to me Greenleaf.</li><br/>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - Why do you have a large calendar on your front page?</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - We place value in our ability not to over commit our resources. We believe that our customers will appreciate the fact we place such value in not spreading our staff thin to accommodate one more event. To this end we will place a notification the calendar for times we are unable to take more live events. We hope that our clients appreciate this when they are choosing times for events.</li><br/>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - Why does your business have two seemingly non-related elements to it: Voice Over (VO) and Web Media? It seems like they wouldn't work together at all.</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - On the contrary, there are elements of every web event that someone gets introduced and a time when the event wraps up. These relate directly to VO or the Voice Talent aspect of my business. I get to blend that aspect of VO work into the part of Web Media I offer. It is not to be underestimated what a clear professional sounding intro and outro can convey to your audience.
		 Regarding the Voice Talent element of my business; I have been fascinated with VO work for quite a while. It is artistically challenging in a way that Web Media isn't. I can provide excellent quality services in a field I am very familiar with while providing excellent quality in an industry I am breaking into.</li><br/>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - Do you feel like you can compete with some other larger companies providing similar services?</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - Absolutely I do. I have been working in the Web Conferencing industry since the late 90's. I feel like I have an edge is in being a small start-up company; no bureaucratic elements to go through to decide if an idea has merit and worth pursuing. I feel like this places me ahead of the curve for delivering the industries newest and most innovative services. I can truly be a leader in this field.</li><br/>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - Are you afraid you will lose customers to your competitors by placing your service pricing open for all to see?</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - Not at all. I feel there needs to be more transparency in industry. I price my services very competitively and charge the same price from a large company as a smaller one instead of trying to gouge the larger one for more money. I feel like my integrity and quality of work will keep my clients happy and knowing what they will be charged for a service before they get billed is a huge benefit. There wont ever be buyer's remorse or sticker shock from anything I provide.</li><br/>
		 <li><b>Q</b> - If you could say one thing to describe yourself or could provide a motto that best describes you, what would it be.</li>
		 <li><b>A</b> - I will not sacrifice my integrity to make a buck. I believe in fair and honest practices, which is not to say I believe any other company does. Simply, I have a basic rule of conduct for doing business and that is to treat everyone honestly and do the very best work I can every time. Sometimes things go sideways and that can't be helped. I don't believe in passing the buck or throwing anyone under the bus. If there is a problem with any aspect of my business, it falls on my shoulders to take responsibility and make it right.</li><br/>
