		 <h2>Testimonials</h2>
		 
		 <ul>
		 <li><b></b> - I just wanted to pass along the below note from an end user at Oracle along with a HUGE thank you from the Oracle Support team. <br />
		 James does quite a few recordings for Oracle users a day and he consistently goes above and beyond. He is always extremely friendly, thorough, <br />
		 and seems genuinely eager to assist.  If I IM him with a question (which happens quite a bit!) where I need some additional clarity, he asks <br />
		 if he can call me to help me understand.  I can say I deal with many individuals on a daily basis within InterCall, and this is not common process, <br />
		 though an extremely effective one.  His overall attitude comes across as not just to assist but actually to exceed expectations and create the best <br />
		 experience for both his internal and external clients. <br />
		 

		We often don't hear enough "good" in the day but I felt it would only be right to take a few minutes to make sure James gets the recognition he deserves. <br />
		Thank you for providing such a phenomenal resource for me and my team!

		Thanks,
		Andrea W. - Oracle
